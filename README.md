# Encryption
My first Encryption app both coded in C#, A variable Caeser Cypher
The way this program works is by shifting the characters in the string forwards multiple times by a different amount each time depending on the position of the character in the input string
The program moves the character forwards 17 times then the second character is moved forwards by 17^2 * theFirstCharacter this chains together the different
characters to make it more diffciult to crack
